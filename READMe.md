Added an hovering class to the buttons when the mouse is over them. this will change the background color of the buttons when the mouse is over them and return them to the normal color when the mouse is off them.

The letter button's background color was changed to green if the leeter is correct and to red if the letter is wrong. Also i added a shaking animation to the wrongly pressed buttons.
